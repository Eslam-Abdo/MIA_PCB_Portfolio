# M.I.A PCB Design Portfolio
This portfolio showcases the PCB designs created by the M.I.A technical team from Alexandria University. The team has participated in various robotics competitions such as MATEROV, Robocon, and Minesweeper. I have contributed to the team's designs as a member of the ABU Robocon team.

## Overview
The M.I.A team has designed and fabricated numerous PCBs for their competition robots using various tools such as Eagle PCB and Altium Designer. The team also creates 3D models of their PCB designs to visualize how they will fit in their robot.

## Projects
This portfolio includes 3D models of the following PCBs that I have designed and fabricated as part of the ABU Robocon team:

- Motor driver circuit
- Sensor interface circuit
- Microcontroller circuit
- Power supply circuit
- Communication circuit

## Preview
Below are 3D models of the PCB designs created by the M.I.A team:
